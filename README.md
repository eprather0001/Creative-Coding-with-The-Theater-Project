# Unit 7 - Creative Animation with The Theater Project

## Introduction

For this project, you will create an animation using The Theater that portrays a personal interest or solves a problem that you choose. Your program should demonstrate the object-oriented programming and software engineering skills and knowledge you have developed throughout the year.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms to create an animation using The Theater:

- **Use inheritance and polymorphism** – Create a superclass that represents shared attributes and behaviors with at least two subclasses that are more specific versions or variations of the superclass.
- **Method decomposition** – Use overloaded, overridden, and private methods to implement different versions of the same behavior, variations of a superclass behavior, and to improve code organization.
- **Use at least two data structures** - Use at least two 1D or 2D arrays or ArrayLists to store elements that are manipulated using loops and conditionals.
- **Implement one or more algorithms** – Implement one or more algorithms that use loops and two-way or multi-selection statements with compound Boolean expressions to analyze the data.
- **Create a visualization** – Create an animation that portrays a personal interest or solves a problem that you choose using objects, data structures, and methods.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions.

## Project Description

For this project, my partner Ellie P. and I decided to create an animation of Gru using the shrink gun to steal the moon with the help of his minions. We decided to create this specific animation because we both love the Despicable Me movie and thought this would be a fun and interesting idea to create. However, we didn't come across any difficult challenges but one, knowing where to start. With the help of Mr. Aiello, he gave us an outline/frame of how we should write our code and we did the rest. In this project, we began by brainstorming ideas onto our Trello board that consists of a TODO list, story board, and our UML diagram. In our TODO list, we need to come up with a super and sub classes with methods that would connect with our user story. Our user story was about a villain named Vector who stole the Giza Pyramids and Gru, another villain who is plotting his revenge on Vector. To one up Vector, Gru decides to steal the Shrink Ray which is used to steal the moon. In our animation, you'll see the opening scene with Vector and the Pyramid in the back. The following scenes will be Gru in his lab with the Shrink Ray, then in space with his minions shrinking the moon, and finally having the moon to himself. To know what type of methods we needed, we created instance variables that would get the specific image file that we would call in our code.
